## Zustand - A React State Management Library

Zustand is a state management libraries for React applications. It offers a way to store and manage the state of your application in a centralized location.

## Why Zustand ?

Zustand is a much simpler library than any other library like Redux. It has a smaller API surface and requires less boilerplate code to set up and use.

This makes it a good choice for smaller projects or developers who are new to state management.

**Complexity :**

Redux is a more complex library than Zustand. It has a larger API surface and requires a more structured approach to managing state.

This can make it a good choice for larger projects or developers who need a more robust and scalable solution.
